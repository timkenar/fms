Creating a local intranet with a Django backend.
Step 1: Install Django REST Framework
Make sure you have Django REST Framework installed:
pip install djangorestframework
Set up a Virtual environment
To install dependancies run : pip install -r requirements.txt
runserver and play with the apis.
test the apis with postman or curl 

Ensure your frontend can communicate with your backend by setting the appropriate CORS headers.
For production, implement a more secure authentication method like JWT.
Test each endpoint using tools like Postman or your frontend to ensure they work as expected.

Enjoy!
More changes to come!!!
